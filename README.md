Decompilation as a Service

_this is pretty jank and was built to support the [OSUSEC Discord Bot](https://gitlab.com/osusec/discord-bot), would not recommend using this in a production environment_

## Setup

1. Install IDA to `/ida` (you need IDA Pro 7+ with Hex-Rays, sorry)
2. Accept the EULA (you can verify this by checking for the existence of `~/.idapro/ida.reg`)
3. Run it: `docker-compose up -d`
